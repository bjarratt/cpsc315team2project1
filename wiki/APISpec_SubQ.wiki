==*class SubQueryOperators*==

class *SubQueryOperators*

The SubQueryOperators class takes on the functionality of SQL subqueries EXISTS, ANY, and ALL.  It uses functions from the class *SingleValOps* to make boolean comparisons and determine if columns and/or rows exist in the *Table*.

===Data Members===

None.

===Constructor Summary===

None.

===Method Summary===

public static Table *existsOp*(Table _myTable_, String _op_, String _query_) - Tests whether the inner query portion of _query_ returns any row based on the comparison made by _op_. If it does, then the outer query portion _query_ proceeds and a new *Table* that meets the _query_ conditions is returned.

public static Table *anyOp*(Table _myTable_, String _op_, String _query_) -  Works like the SQL ANY qualifier. The subquery generates a *Table* which consists of all columns in the specified *Table* that are greater, less than or equal to (depending on the type of _op_) another *Table*.

public static Table *allOp*(Table _myTable_, String _op_, String _query_) - Allows us to check if the condition from _query_ is realized for all the columns  of the *Table*, and returns a new *Table* satisfying these conditions.
