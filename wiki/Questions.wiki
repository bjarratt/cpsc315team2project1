Q: Gabriel

running into an issue with programming the where function.  Could I
send any given operator two single column JTables and expect a return
of a single column JTable containing "true, false, true, false, true,
true" etc. Example for '>': Query: "number>3"
 
LColumn
5
7
1
3
9
10
 
RColumn
3
3
3
3
3
3
 
Return:
true
true
false
false
true
true

A: Drew

As opposed to just columns where the number is greater than 3?
