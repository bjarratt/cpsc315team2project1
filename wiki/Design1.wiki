Query passes to select, update, or delete function (returns whatever select, update, delete return) <br />

*SELECT* calls *FROM* function to get table, selects data, passes to *WHERE* (returns whatever where returns)<br>
*UPDATE* calls *FROM* function to get table, passes to *WHERE*, modifies entries. (pointers?) <br>
*DELETE*  calls *FROM* function to get table, passes to *WHERE*, deletes entries. (pointers?) <br>

*WHERE* will parse and pass to functions of these 3 categories: table operators, binary operators, comparison operators <br>

*table*: IN, EXISTS, ALL, ANY, these will call a *SELECT* <br>
*binary*: AND, OR, NOT <br>
*comparison*: =, !=, >, <, >=, <= <br>

Additional detail:<br>
*SELECT* needs to preform: AS, COUNT, MIN, MAX

Design Difficulties/Flaws:<br>
Preforming the table operators without a *SELECT* call per row.
