Query passes to select, update, or delete function (returns whatever select, update, delete return)

*SELECT* calls *FROM* function to get table, selects data, passes to *WHERE* (returns whatever where returns)
*UPDATE* calls *FROM* function to get table, passes to *WHERE*, modifies entries. (pointers?)
*DELETE*  calls *FROM* function to get table, passes to *WHERE*, deletes entries. (pointers?)

*WHERE* will parse and pass to functions of these 3 categories: table operators, binary operators, comparison operators
table: IN, EXISTS, ALL, ANY, these will call a *SELECT*
binary: AND, OR, NOT
comparison: =, !=, >, <, >=, <=

Additional detail
*SELECT* needs to preform: AS, COUNT, MIN, MAX

Design Difficulty/Flaw:
Preforming the table operators without a *SELECT* call per row.
